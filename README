This Project is a try out at re analysing the super application through means of :

  Domain driven development
  Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  Event sourcing.

So far nCQRS framework is used, but this may change in the future. What is at stake here too is to provide
some cohesive work method to implement the code through Behaviour driven development and test driven development.

Both Console_UI and Web_UI are client to WCF Service Application service. 

To run this project :

Execute in your sql server 2008
	ApplicationService/ReadModel.sql
	ReadModel/ReadModel.edmx.sql

Run an instance of RavenDB

Change connection string according to your setup :
	ApplicationService/bootstrapper.cs
	ApplicationService/app.config
	ReadModel/app.config
	UI_Web/web.config


Start both ApplicationService & UI_Web, and enjoy what you can..
