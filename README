Introduction
------------

This Project is a try out at re analysing the super application(cleaning management system) through means of :

 - Domain driven development  
 - Command Query Responsibility Segregation  
 - Event sourcing.

nCQRS framework has been used used but is totally discarded now. Current solution implies the use of Joliver Commain domain and events store.

*The application is under hardcore development and so might work or not depending on the day you get it.*

Documentation
-------------

A basic contextmap can be found in the documentation folder.
The initial aim of this project was to give tools to develop a full blown solution using BDD.

    Given (events)
    Then (Command)
    Expect (events)

And to generate some documentation on the fly of the different tests available. Triggering Specs.Documentation will generate html pages in Documentation/Specs,where all test are gathered

To define the bounded context and their interactions (see contextmap.png in documentation)
so far I have found :
 
    - Administration :  (CRUD like)
    - Schedulazione : 	BC responsible for the generation of intervento
    - Appaltatore : 	Handling of Intervento by the appaltatore
    - Controllo :       Control of the intervento through the means of schede and various tools
    - Accounting :      BC responsible for giving numbers and reports depending on accounting rules 



current worries
---------------

 - dealing nicely with command in a sync fashion ?
 - putting in one single exe command handling, eventhandling, and     projection generation?
 - having one readModel per bounded context, I am afraid it is the only way. Should then I have different copies of Area Intervento. I mean to be using one server only, does it make sense then to duplicate this information? use a trick to have every bounded context look at the same part of the read model...
to be think better later
 - experimenting with sagas
 - Rethinking pusblishing , events on their own are not enough, I need to add headers to my enveloppe
