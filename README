This Project is a try out at re analysing the super application through means of :

  Domain driven development
  Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  Event sourcing.

So far nCQRS framework is used, but this may change in the future. What is at stake here too is to provide
some cohesive work method to implement the code through Behaviour driven development and test driven development.

Both Console_UI and Web_UI are client to WCF Service Application service.
