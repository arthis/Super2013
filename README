This Project is a try out at re analysing the super application through means of :

  Domain driven development
  Command Query Responsibility Segregation
  Event sourcing.

nCQRS framework has been used used but is totally discarded now. Current solution implies the use of Joliver Commain domain and events store.

The initial aim of this project was to give tools to develop a full blown solution using BDD.

Given (events)
Then (Command)
Expect (events)

And to generate some documentation on the fly of the different tests available.

The application is under hardcore development and so might work or not depending on the day you get it.

My future points of interest are :

define the bounded context and their interactions
so far I have found :
 
    - Administration (CRUD like)
    - Schedulazione : 	BC responsible for the generation of intervento
    - Appaltatore : 	Handling of Intervento by the appaltatore
    - Controllo :       Control of the intervento through the means of schede and various tools
    - Accounting :      BC responsible for giving numbers and reports depending on accounting rules 

There is one site that might  be split, for instance the Appaltatore  part might be externalized
