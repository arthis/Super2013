Ncqrs project documentation
===========================

This folder contains the Ncqrs documentation. For this moment is only contains
a getting started guide. This guide is written in DocBook, an XML based markup
language. This allows us to publish the documentation as a single webpage, or
for example in ePub format for the e-readers among us.

Editing
-------
DocBook is an easy to learn format that can be edited with a simple text editor.
There are a lot of good [authoring tools][1] for DocBook. We use [OxygenXML][2].
This tool is not free, but you can download a trail version from the website. We
do offer a free license for active contibutors. If you are willing to do some
serious contribution, please let us know!
